## Project information

Our scene is inspired by the Iron Throne Room, from the Game of Thrones. It has the main wall containing two doors and torches to light them and a decorated window. The throne is located in the center of the room. Both pillars have a Targaryen family flag, its name, and a firepit.

We added an extra primitive named HalfTorus to create better door. You can see the XML with this primitive [here](scenes/full-scene.xml).

For this second submission, we made the scene more complex, by adding some animations, spriteText and spriteAnims to it. The animations can be visible in firepit, the window decoration and the Daenerys model, who walks through the palace. The spriteText are present in the pillars and in the characters board above the throne, and the spriteAnims are present in that same board, showing the most important characters of the show, and in the torches, to simulate the fire.

We also added an example of each new primitive to the scene. The primitive Plane makes the background of the characters panel, the primitive Patch makes the palace dome, and the primitive DefBarrel makes the body of the torches.

Every primitive can be seen in more detail in the scene made by "demo.xml" file.

### Strong points of our project
- We have another primitive, one half torus
- Code Documentation
- We made an effort to make modular code. We tried to divide the code in separate functions to make it more readable
- We followed the week plan strictly
- Complex scene ("full-scene.xml"/"LAIG_TP1_XML_T1_G04_v02.xml")
- Scene to check primitive details ("demo.xml")
- Creative animations
- Its possible to listen to GOT theme song. On interface, select Miscellaneous and them Music

### Scene
- Iron throne
- Stairs to the iron throne
- Two torchs, each one with one light source
- One window, with one light source and some decoration around it
- Flags of the House Targaryen, representing the current ruling house
- Pillars, with these flags, the name Targaryen and the firepits
- Characters panel, showing the characters of the show
- A Dome
- You can see our scene [without half torus](scenes/LAIG_TP2_XML_T1_G04_v01.xml) or [with half torus](scenes/full-scene.xml).

## Issues/Problems
We did everything that was proposed to do in this project.
