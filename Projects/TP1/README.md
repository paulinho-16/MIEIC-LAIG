## Project information

Our scene is inspired by the Iron Throne Room, from the Game of Thrones. It has the main wall containing two doors and torches to light them and a decorated window. The throne is located in the center of the room. Both pillars have a Targaryen family flag.

We added an extra primitive named HalfTorus to create better door. You can see the XML with this primitive [here](scenes/full-scene.xml).

### Strong points of our project
- We have another primitive, one half torus
- Code Documentation
- We made an effort to make modular code. We tried to divide the code in separate functions to make it more readable
- We followed the week plan strictly 

### Scene
- Iron throne
- Stairs to the iron throne
- Two torchs, each one with one light source
- One window, with one light source and some decoration around it
- Flags of the House Targaryen, representing the current ruling house
- You can see our scene [without half torus](scenes/LAIG_TP1_XML_T1_G04_v02.xml) or [with half torus](scenes/full-scene.xml).
